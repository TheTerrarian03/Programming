GAME OUTLINE:
Game to make: 
  - snek game <---- <---- <---- (best choice)
General outline of playthrough/game features:
  - Turtle player moves with wasd/arrow keys
  - Randomly generated apples or other fruit
    * once an apple is consumed, a new one spawns
      in a random spot
  - Changes asthetics from the normal snake game
    * different snake color
    * different fruits (as opposed to the normal apple)
    * different background + border colors
  - Stuck in box, if hits border game over
  - box (game space) changes size based on size of window
  - As turtle consumes froot it becomes bigger
    * Add to body length
    * If turtle hits itself game ends
