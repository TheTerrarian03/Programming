Hello! Welcome to my Create Task-- also known as my experimental program that lets you make and play music from sine waves.

How to use the program:
1. Run it! run the 'main.py' file with python. You may have to pip install some libraries if they aren't already installed.
2. Place some notes! On the screen you'll see a grid. When you click a square or click-and-drag over many squares, they will become active and they will play a note. When the song is ultimately played, the notes will play in the order they are written in.
3. Change up the BPM! Drag the slider around to change the bpm from a range of 40 to 240. This BPM value changes how you song will sound in the end- slow, fast, or somewhere in the middle? You choose!
4. Press the play button when you're ready to write your song out and see how it sounds! Pressing this will compile the song and play it back for you to hear.
5. Are you happy with it? If so, pressing the play button will have written the sound out to a 'new song.wav' file, which you can share with all your friends or listen alone!
6. Or maybe you don't like it and want to start over? Click the 'Clear Song' button to wipe the board, reset the squares, and you can start fresh!

Hope you enjoy! Again, this program is in its early stages. I don't know how far it will go, but hopefully wherever it goes it will improve! New features to come.

You also may notice it looks similar to Chrome's Music Lab-- and yes, I did in fact take inspiration from it. While not as polished and clean as the Lab, I hope to improve on my program as time goes on, to ultimately make a music-making program worth playing with for hours.

Cheers-
