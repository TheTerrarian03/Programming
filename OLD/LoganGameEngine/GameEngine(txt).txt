Main Game Engine components would be:
1. Array of "Pixels"
    a. list/array
    b. Each data value contains info about what is there
2. Drawing/Printing mechanism(s)
    a. loop that loops through list/array of "pixels"
    b. for each pixel, check if player is in the location
3. Reading mechanism(s)
    a. reads important info to decide what to do...
4. writing mechanism
    a. ...overwriting the current list/array based on #3.
    b. includes: overwriting.
5. Actual Game mechanism(s)
    a. taking input from user, used to decide how to change player pos info...
    b. ...using the reading and writing mechanisms to do the correct thing.
-- Idea for pixel list/array:
    - make a default list/array
    - each move, change some info in a list containing info about the player, then overwriting a list/array of the
        environment with the default and  then overwriting where needed based on character pos info.
-- Variables:
    a. defaultBoard
    b. currentBoard
    c. playerPosInfo
    d. playerInput (for movement (in "Actual Game mechanism(s)))

Tests:
1. Working list/array printer
2. Working (simple) overwriting mechanism
