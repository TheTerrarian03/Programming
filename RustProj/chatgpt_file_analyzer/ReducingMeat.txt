    I disagree with the premise and idea of putting limits on the meat consumption of, well, anyone, but specifically the U.S. seems silly and pointless, frankly.

    Let's start with some data-backed reasons.
First of all, the original video we watched with the two podcast guys mentioned a ranking of meat consumption per person by country.
On Wikipedia, a page "List of countries by meat consumption" shows a table of countries and how many kg of meat each person consumes as an average for each country.
Sorting by most consumption (2020), the top 5 countries that show up are: Hong Kong, the U.S., Australia, Argentina, and Macao.
So going by that data, they should be targeting China, or also targeting China & Australia too.
With China at 137kg and Australia at 121kg per person, it would seem to me like it would be logical to go after those two as well, since we're all within 10ish kg of each other.

    The other thing is pricing.
Let's say the laws and regulations were passed that made people eat a lot less meat, or even none at all.
What do they do?
Obviously one answer is "oh just go vegetarian/vegan" but trust me not everyone wants to do that.
Sure, my mom does it by choice, and my Aunt is vegetarian for health reasons, but everybody else I know would prefer to just not eat than go vegan/vegetarian.
There is an alternative though, which is fake meat.
Rather than having regular meat sources from cows, chickens, pigs, etc., these fake meats are synthetic or lab-grown sources of meat engineered or designed to be as close to real meat as possible.

    It is pretty cool, I will admit, that there are options for you if you can't have regular meat for any reason, but the problem I still run into is that switching strictly to those methods doesn't really solve any issues in the climate change realm.
Greenhouse gas emissions: sure, it would help limit what gasses are emitted from farming animals, but the energy needed to make the meat synthetically still needs to be sourced from somewhere.
Most likely, that's going to be a coal power plant or another non-zero process.

    The other thing there is pricing. Regular meat is already pricey enough (I've seen the prices at the store, and yikes), and then you'd have to deal with the pricing of these synthetic meats, which are- on average- 2-4x more expensive that the traditional meats they're trying to replace.

The End
